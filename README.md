# 🧩 Glitch Server

Glitch Server is a custom Paper Minecraft project focused on building a corrupted, unstable world where the normal rules of Minecraft don’t always apply.

The world contains "glitched chunks" that alter reality, crops may instantly grow or fail and random events can trigger. Instead of only surviving these glitches, players can collect, craft, and install glitches into themselves to unlock unstable abilities and unique playstyles.

This project is about depth, not minigames.  
One evolving system. One corrupted world. Many broken mechanics.
